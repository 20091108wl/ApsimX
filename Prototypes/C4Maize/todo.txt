I've added these constants but they're currently unused:
- Grain.PotKernelWt																				- done
- Grain.GNMaxCoeff																				- done
- Grain.Pgrt0																					- done
- Grain.Pgrt1																					- done
- Grain.PgrBase																					- done
- Grain.GNK																						- done

- Leaf.aMaxA, bMaxB, cMaxC (largestLeafParams in old apsim)										- done
- Leaf.a0, a1, b0, b1 (bellCurveParams in old apsim) 											- done
- Leaf.CO2TEModifier																			- done

- [Structure].MisAppearanceRate - need to refactor leaf appearance code to work with maize		- done
- [Structure].RemainingLeavesForFinalAppearanceRate2 (leaf_no_rate_change2 in old)				- done

- [Root].SWAfps																					- done

Need to double check that these aren't used:

- x_plant_rld (used for root length density calcs in old apsim)									- done (unimportant/unused)
- y_rel_root_rate (as above)																	- done (unimportant/unused)

- leaf senescence due to age
- avLaiEquilibWater calculation

- fix leaf metabolic ndemand calc (stage lookup)												- done
- marry sorghum/maize Culm.CalcPotentialArea leafNoEffective calculations						- done
- LAI is incorrect in leaf ndemand calcs on day 55												- done
- rue/te (and thus dltDM) are both incorrect on day 55											-
