I've added these constants but they're currently unused:
- Grain.PotKernelWt
- Grain.GNMaxCoeff
- Grain.Pgrt0
- Grain.Pgrt1
- Grain.PgrBase
- Grain.GNK

- Leaf.aMaxA, bMaxB, cMaxC (largestLeafParams in old apsim)
- Leaf.a0, a1, b0, b1 (bellCurveParams in old apsim)
- Leaf.CO2TEModifier

- [Structure].MisAppearanceRate - need to refactor leaf appearance code to work with maize
- [Structure].RemainingLeavesForFinalAppearanceRate2 (leaf_no_rate_change2 in old)

- [Root].SWAfps

Need to double check that these aren't used:

- x_plant_rld (used for root length density calcs in old apsim)
- y_rel_root_rate (as above)
